    In a world where we can stay connected with someone we met 10 years ago on the other side of the globe, we often don’t even know our next-door neighbor.

    Neighbears changes that.
    Our app helps you connect with the people in your own building – with names, photos, and optional details like floor or door location.

<strong>Why Neighbears?</strong>

    <ul>

      <li>  🤝 Easy contact with your neighbors</li>
      <li>🌱 Everyday help (plants, pets, sugar, eggs)</li>

      <li>    🎉 More community & understanding</li>
      <li>    📬 Create events with just an emoji – from “extra carrots” 🥕 to “anyone up for table tennis?” 🏓
      </li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <strong>How it works:</strong>

    <ul>

<li>   📩 Sign up with your address</li>
